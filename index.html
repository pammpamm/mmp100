	<h1>Caroline</h1>
	<p>Caroline lives within a Magic Dimension, called Astoria. This universe is filled with different classes of species. Some of these species have powers, the majority of them residing in the city of Helen, known as the central country of magic. However, Caroline's bloodline is to be almost extinct, with only a remainder of 3 Willow families. This species is known to be Willows, which are magical beings capable of manipulating the laws of nature of defying gravity, with the use of their power of telekinesis. However, within her society, the Willow species are looked down upon and neglected because the society finds their power to be threatening. But Caroline is trying to break through these public perceptions.</p>
